      Our story: Drawing on experience from both sides of the table, co-founder, Jen DeAngelis has served as a digital brand strategist for clients like Hilton Worldwide, Bass Pro Shops, Four Seasons Hotels & Resorts (to name a few), and as a lifestyle influencer on with 20K followers across her platforms. 
      We know how difficult it can be to find and create authentic and effective content with the right brands or influencers, and when the connection is made the real work of a fair deal still needs to happen. 
      SuiteSocial solves for that. We do this by finding the right match between influencers and brands, and by pricing each individual influencer based off of their unique data and performance profile through an AI-driven pricing algorithm (because all influencers with 100K followers are not created equal). Lastly, we provide in-depth analytics to deliver customer insights and *real* ROI to inform brand strategy moving forward.
