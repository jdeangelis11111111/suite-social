      2. GET PAID FAIRLY
    </h2>
    <p>
      We take the guesswork out of the negotiation so that each exchange is priced fairly.

    <blockquote>
      “When creating campaigns I found that influencers didn’t know how much to charge, and I didn’t how much to pay. With SuiteSocial I know the fair price to pay each influencer which makes influencer campaign planning a breeze.”
